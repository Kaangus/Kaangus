Here I'm sharing my first e-commerce project, currently I'm working on.

list-to-add:
 1. User account registration 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
 2. Give permission to users to add some stuff they wanna sell
 3. Some features with user's rating, reviews, comment, chat and so on. It's kinda hard, so I haven't thought about it yet :c
 4. Search tools (elasticsearch) 🔍
 5. Cart, buying (in far future selling) forms
 6. Some AJAX, but for now i have no fine idea
